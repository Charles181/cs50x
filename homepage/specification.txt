    And some more...

Use of bootstrap:
    Used several bootstrap elements, such as cards, containers, navbar, columns and more to give
    the page a better and more responsive look.

Use of Javascript:
    Most of the site doesn't use Javascript, except for the showcase.html page.
    In that page, I created a random password creator, which uses Javascript functions
    in order to generate a random password, given the type of characters wanted and the
    desired length. It also modifies a small div's background color to indicate strength
    of the password.
    Also, I created a JS function to add an event listener to the copy icon, in order to
    make it copy the generated password into the clipboard.
